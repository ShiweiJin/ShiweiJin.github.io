Currently I am working towards the Ph.D. in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego. I am supervised by [Prof. Truong Q. Nguyen](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=48) at the [Video Processing Lab](http://videoprocessing.ucsd.edu/). I received the B.S. in optical science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2018, and the M.S. in electrical and computer engineering from University of California, San Diego, CA, USA, in 2020. My research interests include 2D/3D feature matching and gaze estimation.
